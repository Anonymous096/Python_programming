In function that we made if you want to store that in a variable then in that function returning the function is necessary.

def func(a, b):
	sum = a+b
	return sum	# this is mandatory
s = func(5, 7)	# if storing like this then return is mandatory
print(s)	# if didn't return the func it will return none.

What is doc string?
It is a short aknowledgement of what the function do 

we can apply it as:

def func(a, b):
	"""This is a docString"
	sum = a+b
	print(sum)
	return sum
func(5,7)
print(func, __doc__) # This is how you can print docstring of any function
