when you made these functions you have to make a new py file where you need to 
use this file name as "import <file_name> and print(<file_name>.<function_name>)"
Here calc is a module which I've created and I imported this module in module.py file.

in order to call a particular function or keyword you have to write command as:
from <file_name> import <keyword/function_name>

while importing if want to change the name the command is:
import <file_name> as <short_name>

we can use built-in functions also such as math or pandas etc.
nothing will change just in place of <file_name> write the name of the built-in function.

calc.py is module file and modules.py is the file where I called it by import function
